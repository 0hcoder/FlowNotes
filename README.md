# FlowNotes

FlowNotes is a flexible and creative note-taking web app designed to help users capture their ideas in multiple formats and organize them easily with drag-and-drop functionality. This project was built as part of a Hackathon and completed within 2 days, so while it aims to be fully functional, there may still be some bugs. We welcome feedback and contributions!
